 ## Usage Instructions
 * Navigate to releases and download the latest (*.exe* for Windows, *.out* for Linux)
 * Do NOT run the executable directly, but instead navigate to the file in cmd/bash and run with `Main` (Windows) or `./Main.out` (Linux)
 * Enter a valid absolute or relative path to a valid board (see examples)
   * Absolute path would look something like *C:\Users\Username\Path-to-directory\board1.txt* (Windows)
   * Relative path would look something like *board1.txt*, if it exists in the same directory
   * Best to put the file in the same directory as the executable, and use the relative path
 * Sit back and relax as your puzzle is solved!
 
 Currently tested on Windows 10 and Ubuntu 20.04
