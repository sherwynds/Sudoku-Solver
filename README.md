# Sudoku-Solver
 This is a Sudoku solver using various search strategies - currently using DFS (Backtracking)
 
 ## Usage Instructions
 * Either clone this repository and build *Main.cpp* (using *run.bat* on Windows/MSVC), or navigate to releases and download the latest
 * Do NOT run *Main.exe* directly, but instead navigate to the file in command prompt and run with `Main`
 * Enter a valid absolute or relative path to a valid board (see examples)
   * Absolute path would look something like *C:\Users\Username\Path-to-directory\board1.txt*
   * Relative path would look something like *board1.txt*, if it exists in the same directory
 * Sit back and relax as your puzzle is solved!
 
 Currently tested on Windows 10, plans for Linux release in the future.
